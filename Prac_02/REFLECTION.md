# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I watched 50% of the videos. I prefer watching PPT files to watching videos. I would only watch the instructional videos if I didnâ€™t understand the parts in the PPT. But I would make sure to understand all the knowledge points every week.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

My class is on Monday, so I will choose a morning on the weekend before Monday to preview the content of next week's class at home and watch the course video at the same time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think the best part of this course is that I can follow the teacher's ideas in class and improve my own code when the teacher improves the code on the blackboard. This makes me feel a sense of progress and accomplishment.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to change my bad habit of leaving homework until the last two days, and I also need to complete the extra content to increase the amount of practice.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I need to carefully read the content in GitHub every week to make sure I have completed all the weekly tasks as required

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I did well in this practical class. I followed the teacher's ideas, practiced programming in class and improved the code.
